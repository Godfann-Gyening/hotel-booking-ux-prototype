# Hotel Booking Interface Prototype (UX/Figma)

This project involved the design and user testing of an online booking system interface for a small hotel chain, focusing on user experience (UX) and interaction design principles. Developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) assignment, the prototype demonstrates key functionalities for hotel search, room booking, and optional extras, with an emphasis on usability and error prevention.

## üöÄ Project Goal

To design an intuitive and efficient online booking interface that allows customers to:
*   Specify hotel and room requirements (location, dates, number of rooms/guests).
*   View hotel details, ratings, and facilities.
*   Book optional extras (e.g., breakfast, early check-in, gym pass).
*   Review and modify bookings before purchase.
*   Complete payment and receive confirmation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Location Support:** Interface designed to handle hotels across four distinct locations.
*   **Flexible Booking Options:** Allows selection of multiple rooms, different room types (Classic Double, Deluxe, Twin, Family Suite), and varying guest counts.
*   **Optional Extras:** Integration for booking additional services with quantity selection and per-room charges.
*   **Multi-Currency Display:** Prices viewable in Pounds (¬£) and one other chosen currency.
*   **Voucher Code Application:** Functionality to apply discount codes.
*   **Interactive Review Stage:** Users can modify or remove selected rooms/extras before final purchase.
*   **Payment Simulation:** Supports card payments and simulates third-party payment processing.
*   **Confirmation Page:** Displays booking summary post-payment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

*   **Design & Prototyping:** Figma
*   **User Research:** Cognitive Walkthroughs, Rettig-style User Testing (using UXtweak for data collection)
*   **Documentation:** Structured HCI report, academic referencing (Harvard style)

## üîí Security & Usability Focus

While primarily a design project, the process inherently focused on aspects critical to secure and reliable systems:
*   **Error Prevention:** Design choices aimed at minimizing user errors during input and selection.
*   **Clear Feedback:** Providing unambiguous messages for valid/invalid inputs, booking status, and payment outcomes.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:** Designing for a wide range of users, including responsive layouts and legible typography.
*   **Data Integrity (Conceptual):** Structuring information flow to ensure accurate booking details are captured and presented.

## üìà Outcomes & Learning

*   Successfully designed a comprehensive, interactive lo-fi prototype in Figma.
*   Conducted rigorous usability testing, including cognitive walkthroughs and observed user tests, to identify pain points and gather insights.
*   Iterated design based on user feedback, demonstrating an understanding of user-centered design principles.
*   Developed skills in structured reporting, data analysis (from UXtweak results), and presenting design rationale.
